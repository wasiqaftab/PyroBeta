# PyroBeta

PyroBeta is a simple beta-management module for PyroCMS. You can take beta sign ups as well as invite users. After they have been invited or you have approved their beta application, they can go to a special URL that they receive via email and enter in their account details to create an account.

PyroBeta is still in development for a 1.0 so send feedback to [@Parse19](http://twitter.com/parse_19).

Docs and more details forthcoming.
